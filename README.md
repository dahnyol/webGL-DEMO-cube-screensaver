# Cube Screensaver
An old school windows inspired screensaver that runs in the browser.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebGL
First time using WebGL.

## Lessons Learned:
An attempt to dip my toes in something brand new. 
Stumbled upon WebGL and how it is a way to utilize an API to render 2D and 3D in HTML without the use of additional plug-ins.
